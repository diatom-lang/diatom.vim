# diatom.vim

Syntax highlight for [the Diatom programming language](https://github.com/diatom-lang/diatom). It will automatically detect `.dm` files. It should be compatiable with both `vim` and `neovim`.

## Installation
Use your favourite plugin manager or do it by hand.

For example, if you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) then add this to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`.
```vim
Plug 'diatom-lang/diatom.vim'
```
after `call plug#begin()`.
